# ML-based Biomarker Discovery for Wilson Disease

## Overview
This repository contains a transcriptomics and machine learning pipeline to identify candidate biomarkers associated with Wilson disease using public gene expression data.

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and normalization
2. Differential gene expression analysis
3. Machine learning–based feature selection
4. Model evaluation using cross-validation
5. Biological validation through heatmaps and pathway enrichment

## Tools
- R (limma, ggplot2, clusterProfiler)
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)

## Notes
Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation due to limited sample size.
Identified biomarkers are candidates and require experimental validation.
